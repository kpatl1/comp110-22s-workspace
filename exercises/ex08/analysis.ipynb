    "\n",
    "Reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and **brainstorm modifications to the course that _create value_ beyond its current design**. When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Stakeholder: Students Enrolled\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Many implications of the course come from its hybrid format, as compared to a traditional course. Most STEM courses at UNC and other insitutions do not follow this format and could potentially pose a disadvantage to individuals with learning disabilities, struggling work-ethics, and lack-of-focus. In order to combat this, and for the stakeholder the course is actually consumed by, this idea propose that there be a reversion to the original format of the course -- fully in-person and synchronous. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stakeholder: Instructional Staff\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With an overcrouded department comes overworked staff. This idea proposes that as an another requirement to join the major, the summer or winter break previous to taking 110, there be 5-10 hour long precourse work utilizing exceptionally well produced pre-made videos from Kris Jordan to learn the basics of programming and mostly covering the first few weeks of the 110 curriculum. This will help students know if computer science is the field for them, as well as allowing students to have a grasp on the course if they have no prior-experience or need to form a stronger base. This will also allow for the semester sessions of the course to focus more on strenghtening the fundamentals of programming while also being able to go more in-depth with some more advanced topics. This idea not only allows instructional staff to have an easier time working with students with more individualized problems, but can also keep more motivated students to pursue the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stakeholder: Students Enrolled\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This idea breaks the idea of 110 being a course for students of all majors. Although, it is a wonderful design to the course currently, there are extremely high numbers of students attempting to enroll into the course for their major. While 116 is also offered for other STEM specific majors, students are also taking 110 because they want to see if Computer Science is a field interesting to them or as an elective. This idea turns 110 into a more Computer Science major/minor oriented course that is open to students interested in pursuing the field or is already a declared major/minor. A new course, COMP 105, will become a course similar to 110 but intended for students not wanting to pursue Comptuer Science as a dedicated field. This opens up 110 to have seats for all intended majors and allows 105 to be a course allowing students that are not working towards a Computer Science degree to gain programming experience and could potentially replace the 110 credit for their major -- ex. Applied Mathematics. This allows for more versatility for students in choosing a field as well as crafting a better learning experience for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stakeholder: Societal Workforce\n",
    "   \n",
    "    As previouslly mentioned, UNC remains an institution regarded with high academic standing nationwide. Students planning on entering the workforce want to be equipped with a strong toolkit to succeed in any role. To benefit the current workforce, UNC can work to strenghten its current Comptuer Science program to be better equipped to build stronger students and programmers. One of the main accenuations from companies today, is the value of students with more personal projects. To craft this into improving COMP 110, the curriculum can be geared to emphazise the importance of building more personally branded ideas and crafting them into assignments testing the understanding of in-class concepts. Therefore, more open-ended assignments can allow students to understand the value of personal projects and will develop more creative and versatile students for the workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stakeholder: Academic Institution\n",
    "   \n",
    "    UNC continues to reign as a \"Public Ivy\" and holds high regard to its academic standards and rigor. With increasing applications continuing every cycle, acceptance rates continue to drop while departments still remain overcrowded and underrated. One of these departments is the Computer Science program, and though there are measures now put into place to help avoid this overcrowding, students tend to respond negatively to ideas such as an application to the Major. This idea propose the university allocate more funding to the Computer Science program to allot more spots for interested and motiviated students into 110, and strengthen the nationwide ranking of the program itself. Especially with the resources and videos created, new students should have the resources to succeed as a student in 110 but also as a major if they decide to pursue that path. "

    "### Part 5. Conclusion \n",
    "After the data analysis, it was found that the numbers were able to support the idea that for COMP 110, the course shold return to fully synchronous. From the first analysis in the project it was found that almost 17 percent of students would have found an increase in their preformance in the class if Tuesday's were in-person. This is around 122 students mentioning a better experience in 110. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there can be further refinements made. When regarding the videos and out-of-class work, the data seems to support not having assigned reverse learning over the weekend and on Monday's. This comes from only 62 people out of the 108 who want synchronous classes vowing to watch extra videos outside of class if there was fully in-person class on Tuesday's. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some futher refinement to this idea can be that the class can be to not have the pre-recordeded videos be assigned, but instead, go over that on the Tuesday class in-person. This brings another effect of removing asynchronous Tuesday's, is that students' out of class online work time would decrease as they would not be spending the time watching videos online, but learning the content in-person -- as can be seen in the final graphic figure in the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, with every idea, there are bound to be potential trade-off's, or groups that are negatively affected. In this case, the instructional staff would be negatively affected as they would have to prepare more for the Tuesday classes, and have a higher work load as a result. Some potential costs revolve around extra facility use and wear or other courses that were in the room when 110 would now hold lecture would have to relocate. However, there are also other positive externalities. If Tuesday classes were to be in-person, then the academic institution would benefit, as their students would be performing better and reflecting in higher ratings not only for COMP 110, but the Computer Science department as a whole.
